<p>The start of my journey, reading christian apologetics. Same as you &mdash; I&rsquo;ve grown up believing it was shameful for educated people to be publicly religious or anything else incompatible with <em>e.g.</em> rationalism and skepticism. Just like you — since I was very young, I think about questions like what is the nature of reality, the purpose/meaning of life, etc. Just like everyone &mdash; I ignored that theologians and religious people have been thinking about the same questions for the last 5,000 years(?), gathering an impressive body of knowledge and probably concluded something useful.</p>
<p>In a way, it feels like the book was set up for failure from the start, as it attempts something overly ambitious: to make a rational case for Christian faith and explain Christianity from first principles, its morals but also the harder stuff like the supernatural, God, the nature of reality, and so on. It&rsquo;s a magnificent effort, though, and I felt expanded after finishing it. I knew about C.S. Lewis&rsquo; work for children (<em>e.g.</em> Chronicles of Narnia) but was unaware he also wrote philosophy. After reading this book, I definitely want to read the rest of his work. Just when I was feeling satisfied towards the end and thinking &ldquo;Yeah, ok — I got it&rdquo;, the book ends with a surprising suggestion related to evolution, which I&rsquo;ve never seen written anywhere else.</p></div>

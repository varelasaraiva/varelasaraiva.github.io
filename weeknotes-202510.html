<li>It’s March, the meteorological spring has started, the weather has been lovely in this part of the planet. After the snow bells, crocuses and daffodils are everywhere and cherry trees are blossoming.</li>
<li>There was Formula 1 pre-season testing in Bahrain and this week we have the first race of the season in Melbourne. I have a lot to say about this but will spare my readership and just write a few commonplace ideas: the last season before major changes in regulation is usually the best with performance convergence across the field, where usually everyone asks themselves <em>Why are we changing the formula if this is so good?</em>. On the other hand, McLaren seems to have made another step forward in performance — still to be confirmed — and this season could be a duel between Norris and Piastri, reminiscent of Hamilton vs Rosberg in 2014. </li>
<li>I’ve ordered a <a href="https://www.keychron.uk/products/keychron-k1-pro-qmk-via-wireless-custom-mechanical-keyboard-iso-layout-collection?variant=45743748022442">Keychron K1 Pro</a> with PBT keycaps and brown switches. Since I spend so much time typing, thought it would be nice to use something substantially better than the £20 mechanical keyboard I’ve been using in the past few years. It’s all about the small pleasures.</li>
<li>We used to slog almost 7 months straight after the Christmas break and spend the first holiday period around the end of June but for the first time in 18 years we’ll be spending Easter in Lisbon, to better align with the school holidays. I think it’s great.</li>
<li>Wish you all a fantastic week!</li>

<li>There was today the first Formula 1 Grand Prix of the season in Melbourne. I’m watching it as I write this week’s notes. It is being quite entertaining. The McLaren seems to be the class of the field, confirming the suspicions of the pre-season testing. It seems this year’s car is very good at not putting too much strain in the tires, slowing the rate of decay in performance and allowing the drivers to push for longer.</li>
<li>I was confident at the end of last year that very soon I’d have more time and energy because nights with the 1 year old were going to improve but it’s already mid-March and it seems the year is flying by and I haven’t crossed anything from the 2025 objectives yet</li>
<li>I have been listening to the remix of Severance soundtrack, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRnDYB28bL8">Music To Refine To</a>, while working and it’s pretty good. I’ve never watched the show but everything I’ve seen about it looks great, right up my alley. On the other hand, I get the sense it would be a depressing watch as the premise hits too close to home.</li>
<li>There’ll be more next week - see you then!</li>

<li>Welcome to the first edition of Weeknotes, an experiment in www. I’m going to keep it short this week. Let’s not make this too much of a challenge.</li>
<li>After some minor minor polish to the backend, I’ve been adding some content — my reading lists — to the wiki. <a class="wikilink" href="ubuntu-on-pixelbook.html">This node</a> was getting too lonely. This is the first update in what, two years? I hope the next update doesn’t take as long to come out as this one.</li>
<li>Obviously, I’m already planning another rewrite of the backend.</li>
<li>In work news, we had an afternoon social on Wednesday, where we had lunch somewhere in Covent Garden and threw some darts at the Flight Club. I thought it was very enjoyable. Always nice to spend time with my co-workers.</li>
<li>Towards the end of the week, I’ve started to have some minor cold symptoms which developed into something more annoying over the weekend. Didn’t disrupt work but made my Saturday a bit miserable.</li>
<li>And that’s it! That wasn’t too hard.</li>
